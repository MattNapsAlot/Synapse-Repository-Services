Welcome to Synapse, a service operated by Sage Bionetworks, an IRS 501(c)(3) public charity<b> </b>("<b>Sage Bionetworks</b>," "<b>we</b>," or "        <b>us</b>"). These Terms and Conditions of Use ("<b>Terms</b>") are a binding legal agreement between you and Sage Bionetworks regarding your use of
        Synapse, Sage Bionetworks' computational and storage software platform enabling collaborative, data-driven research on integrative genomic datasets,
        including any replacements thereof and successors thereto ("<b>Synapse</b>" or the "<b>Service</b>"). Synapse is comprised of a publicly-available
        portion designed to enable combined analysis of genomic data (the "<b>Synapse Commons</b>"), as well as workspaces on Synapse designated as private by
        a Synapse user ("<b>Private Workspaces</b>"). Unless otherwise indicated in these Terms, all references to Synapse and the Service include both the
        Synapse Commons and Private Workspaces.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please read these Terms carefully. By using Synapse, or downloading, uploading, installing, or using any genomic, molecular, phenotypic and/or other
        data from human or non-human sources ("<b>Data</b>"), any algorithms, tools, and other software code in source or object form ("<b>Software</b>"), or
        any other information and content (such content, including Software, is referred to in these Terms as "<b>Content</b>") available on or through
        Synapse, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and use Synapse and all Data and Content in compliance with this Agreement. If you are using the
        Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind such company or entity to
        this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
In addition, when using certain features of Synapse, you also will be subject to the guidelines, terms, and agreements applicable to such features ("        <b>Policies</b>"). All such Policies are incorporated by reference into these Terms. If these Terms are inconsistent with any Policy, the terms in the
        Policy will control to the extent of the inconsistency.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may periodically make changes to these Terms. We will notify registered users by email of any material changes to these Terms, so please keep your
        registered email address current. By using Synapse, you accept these Terms and any modifications that we may make to these Terms. It is your
        responsibility to review the most recent version of the Terms frequently and remain informed of any changes to these Terms. If you continue to use
        Synapse after we modify these Terms, you will be deemed to have consented to terms of the modified agreement for your use of Synapse as of the date of
        the modification. If you do not agree to any provision of these Terms, you must not use Synapse.

        <b>Overview</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Synapse gives registered users the ability to upload and make available to other users Data and Software. Any Data or Software that is posted or
        transmitted by any user of Synapse other than Sage Bionetworks is referred to in these Terms as "<b>User Materials</b>."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Data will be made available through the Synapse Commons using a three-tier data access system, as discussed in greater detail in the Synapse Commons
        Data Access and Use Procedure and the Synapse Commons Data Sharing Policy (collectively, the "<b>Synapse Commons Data Terms of Use</b>"). This Section
        4(a) contains a brief overview of the three-tier data access systems used for the Synapse Commons, but you should review the Synapse Commons Data Terms
        of Use carefully. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Section 4(a) and the Synapse Commons Data Terms of Use, the Synapse
        Commons Data Terms of Use govern to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        While it is Sage Bionetworks' policy to promote Data sharing with as few restrictions as possible (Tier 1) on the Synapse Commons, the Synapse Commons
        accommodates Data sharing under restricted conditions when required by informed consent, legal contract and/or privacy requirements as disclosed by the
        Data contributor (Tiers 2 and 3). This process is designed to allow Data sharing within the legal and ethical framework for responsible use of genomic
        Data.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        -Tier 1 Data includes Data that may be shared in an open-access manner. Users have authority to access all Tier 1 datasets following agreement to these
        Terms and Conditions of Use.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        -Tier 2 Data access requires agreement to additional Data-specific terms of use. These terms are imposed only when required to maintain protections,
        regulatory or legal conditions described as part of informed consent or legal contracts enacted during the process of Data generation and disclosed by
        the Data contributor.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        - Tier 3 is reserved for Data requiring additional protections due to inclusion of potentially sensitive information. Tier 3 Data use requires IRB
        authorization of intended data use as described in the Synapse Commons Data Terms of Use.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Individuals interested in submitting Data to the Synapse Commons must comply with the Synapse Commons Data Terms of Use, including their requirement to
        work with Sage Bionetworks to ensure that Data is shared using the appropriate terms of use and restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any User Materials posted, stored, or uploaded by you or any third party, or for any loss or
        damage to any User Materials. Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor any User Materials posted on or transmitted through Synapse
        (other than Data posted to the Synapse Commons, to the extent described in the Synapse Commons Data Access and Use Procedure and the Synapse Commons
        Data Sharing Policy),<b> </b>we reserve the right, and have absolute discretion, to remove and screen, any User Materials posted, stored, or
        transmitted on or through Synapse at any time and for any reason without notice.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, although we provide you with the opportunity to use Private Workspaces on Synapse, and to only designate Content and Data as accessible to
        certain other Synapse users, we make no representation or warranty that access to such Content or Data, or to any Private Workspace, by unauthorized
        individuals or entities will not occur.

    <p>
        <br/>
        IN NO EVENT WILL SAGE BIONETWORKS OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
        CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR ACCESS OF OR INABILITY TO USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT

        THE MAXIMUM TOTAL LIABILITY OF Sage Bionetworks AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS under these terms or otherwise in connection with

        APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS IN
        THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH CASES, YOU AGREE THAT BECAUSE SUCH WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY REFLECT A REASONABLE

        BIONETWORKS, SAGE BIONETWORKS' AND ITS LICENSORS' AND SUPPLIERS' LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

        EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS
        UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE
        PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY
        FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

        Our failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive our ability to act with respect to that circumstance or similar circumstances. Any
        provision of these Terms that is found to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable will be severed from these Terms, and the remaining provisions of
        these Terms will continue to be in full force and effect. The section headings and titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or
        contractual effect. Any provision in these Terms that by its nature should survive the termination of your license to access the Service or any
        termination of these Terms (including, without limitation, provisions governing indemnification, limitations on liability, disclaimers of warranty, and
        ownership of intellectual property) will continue to remain in full force and effect after any such termination.

        These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, excluding conflict of laws principles. Any controversy or claim arising out of or
        relating to the Service or these Terms must be commenced within one year after the claim arose and will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance
        with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such controversy or claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis,
        and will not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration will be conducted in King County,
        Washington and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court of competent jurisdiction. The award of the arbitrator will be final and
        binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by Washington law. Either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive
        relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, as necessary to protect the party's rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.
